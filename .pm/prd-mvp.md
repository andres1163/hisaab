# Khaata — MVP Product Requirements Document

**Project:** Khaata (Open Source Trading Journal for Indian Traders)
**Author:** Devansh Tiwari
**Date:** 2026-03-20
**Status:** Draft
**Parent Product:** Metis (AI-powered stock analysis)
**License:** MIT (open source)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

**91% of F&O traders lost money in FY25** (SEBI data). Aggregate losses: Rs 1.05 lakh crore.

The #1 differentiator between profitable and losing traders is journaling — yet <1% of Indian traders maintain any formal trade journal. The reason isn't motivation — it's **friction**. Manual data entry kills discipline. Existing tools are either too expensive (USD pricing), too basic (Zerodha Console), or require complex setup (database, auth, hosting).

**The core insight:** Traders don't need another app to maintain. They need to **upload a CSV and see their real win rate in 2 minutes** — zero signup, zero setup.

---

## 2. Product Vision

An **open-source, zero-auth, browser-only** trading journal that gives Indian traders instant P&L analytics from their broker CSV/XLSX exports. No signup, no database, no server — everything runs in the browser and stays on the user's device.

**Strategic role:** Acts as the top-of-funnel for Metis. Traders who discover their patterns here get a natural bridge to Metis's AI-powered stock analysis for improving their decisions.

```

Post-trade analysis                Pre-trade intelligence
```

## 3. Target Users

### Primary: Indian F&O & Swing Traders
- 10M+ active F&O traders, 91% losing money
- Currently using Google Sheets, Excel, or nothing
- Price-sensitive (75% earn <Rs 5L/year)
- Trade on Zerodha, Groww, Upstox, Angel One
- Mobile-first (77% of Indian web traffic)
- Want to improve but don't know where to start

### Secondary: Equity Delivery Investors
- 136M unique investors in India
- Track STCG/LTCG for tax filing
- Need scrip-wise P&L for ITR-2/ITR-3

---

## 4. Design Principles

1. **Zero friction** — No signup, no database, no API keys. Upload CSV → see dashboard.
2. **Instant gratification** — Show the "aha moment" within 2 minutes of first visit.
3. **Privacy-first** — All data stays in browser (localStorage/IndexedDB). Nothing leaves the device.
4. **India-native** — INR formatting, Indian broker support, FY (Apr-Mar) awareness, Indian tax structure.
5. **Mobile-optimized** — PWA installable, responsive-first, touch-friendly.
6. **Open source** — MIT license, clean code, well-documented, contributor-friendly.

---

## 5. Technical Constraints

| Constraint | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| No authentication | localStorage + IndexedDB | Zero friction, privacy-first |
| No database | Browser storage only | No server costs, no hosting complexity |
| No backend | Static Next.js export or client-only | Deployable on Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages |
| Framework | Next.js App Router + TypeScript | Same stack as Metis, code sharing potential |
| UI | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Same design system as Metis |
| Charts | Recharts or Lightweight Charts | Proven, performant |
| File parsing | Papa Parse (CSV) + SheetJS (XLSX) | Handles all broker formats |
| Data storage | IndexedDB via Dexie.js | Structured queries, large datasets |

---

## 6. MVP Phases

### Phase 1: "The Hook" — CSV Upload + Instant P&L Dashboard
> **Goal:** Upload broker CSV → see your real win rate in 2 minutes. No signup.

#### Features

**P1.1 — Broker CSV/XLSX Parser**
- Support Zerodha tradebook CSV (primary — largest user base)
- Support Groww XLSX export (secondary — fastest growing)
- Auto-detect broker from file structure (column headers, date formats)
- Normalize all trades into unified internal format
- Handle date format variations (YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY)
- Handle F&O symbol naming conventions (NIFTY24MARFUT, BANKNIFTY24MAR52000CE)
- Display parsing errors clearly (which rows failed, why)

**Unified Trade Schema:**
```typescript
interface Trade {
  id: string
  broker: 'zerodha' | 'groww' | 'upstox' | 'angel'
  symbol: string
  isin?: string
  exchange: 'NSE' | 'BSE'
  segment: 'EQ' | 'FO' | 'CD'
  tradeType: 'BUY' | 'SELL'
  quantity: number
  price: number
  tradeDate: Date
  executionTime?: Date
  orderId?: string
  tradeId?: string
}
```

**P1.2 — FIFO Trade Matching**
- Match BUY/SELL trades using FIFO (First In, First Out) method
- Support partial fills (buy 100, sell 50 → matched + 50 open)
- Support LONG trades (buy first, sell later) — equity + F&O futures
- Support SHORT trades (sell first, buy to cover) — F&O only
- Track open/unmatched positions
- Financial year awareness (Apr 1 - Mar 31)

**Matched Trade Schema:**
```typescript
interface MatchedTrade {
  id: string
  symbol: string
  segment: 'EQ' | 'FO'
  direction: 'LONG' | 'SHORT'
  entryDate: Date
  exitDate: Date
  entryPrice: number
  exitPrice: number
  quantity: number
  pnl: number
  pnlPercent: number
  holdingDays: number
  status: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN'
}
```

**P1.3 — Instant P&L Dashboard**
- **KPI Cards (top row):**
  - Net P&L (Rs) with color (green/red)
  - Win Rate (%)
  - Total Trades
  - Profit Factor (gross profit / gross loss)
  - Average Win vs Average Loss
  - Best Trade / Worst Trade
- **Charts:**
  - Cumulative P&L curve (line chart)
  - Monthly P&L bars (bar chart)
  - Win/Loss distribution (histogram)
- **Trade Table:**
  - Sortable by date, symbol, P&L, holding period
  - Color-coded rows (green for profit, red for loss)
  - Search/filter by symbol
- **Open Positions:**
  - List of unmatched buys with current unrealized status

**P1.4 — Data Persistence (IndexedDB)**
- Store parsed trades in IndexedDB (Dexie.js)
- Store matched trades separately
- Support multiple imports (append, not replace)
- Duplicate detection by trade ID + date
- Export all data as JSON backup
- "Clear all data" button with confirmation

**P1.5 — File Drop Zone / Upload UX**
- Drag-and-drop area prominently on first visit
- "See your real win rate in 2 minutes" headline
- Broker selection chips (auto-detect if possible)
- Progress indicator during parsing
- Success state → redirect to dashboard
- Demo mode with sample data (no upload needed)

## 12. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Broker changes CSV format | Parsing breaks | Version parsers, test against real files, community reports |
| IndexedDB storage limits | Data loss for heavy traders | Warn at 80% capacity, offer JSON export |
| Cannibalize Metis signups | Strategic misalignment | Clear separation: Khaata = backward-looking, Metis = forward-looking AI |
| Low GitHub traction | No funnel value | README-first development, demo GIF, launch strategy |
| FIFO matching bugs | Wrong P&L → trust destroyed | Extensive test suite against known broker outputs |
| SEBI regulatory changes | Tax calculations outdated | Version tax rates, document FY applicability |

---

## 13. Launch Strategy

## 14. Relationship to Metis

```
                     Khaata (This Project)
                     ─────────────────────
                     "What happened?"
                     Post-trade analysis
                     Free, open source
                     Browser-only, no auth
                            │
                            │  "Want to make better decisions?"
                            │  Contextual CTAs at insight moments
                            ▼
                     Metis (Paid Product)
                     ────────────────────
                     "What should I do next?"
                     Pre-trade AI analysis
                     Paid, cloud-hosted
                     Full auth + persistence
```

The funnel works because:
- Khaata shows traders their **problems** (low win rate, revenge trading, poor R:R)
- Metis offers the **solution** (AI-powered stock analysis for better entry/exit decisions)
- The upgrade moment is natural, not forced
