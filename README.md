### Why

91% of F&O traders lost money last year. The #1 differentiator between profitable and losing traders is journaling, yet almost no one does it. The reason isn't motivation. It's friction.

Hisaab removes the friction entirely.

<br />

### How it works

```
1. Export your tradebook from Zerodha or Groww
2. Drop the file on hisaab.trymetis.app
3. See your P&L, win rate, and patterns. Instantly.
```

That's it. No account. No setup. Everything runs in your browser and stays on your device.

<br />

### What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **Instant P&L** | Net profit, win rate, profit factor. Computed in seconds. |
| **FIFO Matching** | Automatic buy/sell matching with partial fill support |
| **Visual Analytics** | Cumulative equity curve, monthly P&L bars, trade distribution |
| **Multi-Broker** | Zerodha CSV, Groww XLSX. More coming. |
| **FY Aware** | Indian financial year (Apr to Mar) built in |
| **100% Private** | IndexedDB storage, zero network requests, verifiable via DevTools |
