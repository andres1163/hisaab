### Why

91% of F&O traders lost money last year. The #1 differentiator between profitable and losing traders is journaling, yet almost no one does it. The reason isn't motivation. It's friction.

Hisaab removes the friction entirely.

<br />

### How it works

```
1. Export your tradebook from Zerodha or Groww
2. Drop the file on hisaab.trymetis.app
3. See your P&L, win rate, and patterns. Instantly.
```

That's it. No account. No setup. Everything runs in your browser and stays on your device.

<br />

### What you get

If your broker isn't supported, [open a broker support request](https://github.com/Devansh-365/hisaab/issues/new?template=broker_support.yml) with an anonymized sample CSV. New to open source?
